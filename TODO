;TODO: for v1.0.0

;TODO: make the indenting for template definitions/specializations consistent: currently there is a difference between templated functions and templated structures (mainly because there is not a standard form for functions)

;TODO: fix constructor-assignment-chunk to accept multiple values as arguments...

;TODO: change writor to use logical lines/sections for writing instead of nekots
;TODO: change chunks (chunk-transform, specifically) to generate logical lines/sections instead of nekots


;TODO: for v1.1.0

;TODO: add properties back in - for user-defined indents and the like


;TODO: for v1.5.0

;TODO: clean up eval in io.rkt to use racket/base and standard-chunks.rkt only - for speed?
;TODO: find a way to limit eval in io.rkt so that it doesn't have access to the file system  (something less than racket/base, probably)


;TODO: for v2.0.0

;TODO: extend properties to as many conceivable formatting settings as possible


;TODO: general

;TODO: finish the top-level todo list ;)

;TODO: fix bug in FieldExpression.fm in constructor assignment list indent - no other repeatable test (yet)
