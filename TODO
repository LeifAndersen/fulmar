;TODO: add version number information to fulmar - quick sanity check that versions (fulmar's version and file's syntax version) are compatible
;TODO: fix constructor-assignment-chunk to accept multiple values as arguments...
;TODO: convert chunks from closure formulation to something transparent (a struct, probably)
;TODO: change writer so that does indenting and new-lining after too many characters have been printed - this should eliminate the need for immediate-chunk
;TODO: write and test normal-chunk - not needed?
;TODO: add new-lines-chunk and base new-line-chunk off of it
;TODO: change function-declare-chunk so that the number of parameters doesn't matter - combine return type with return type qualifications
;TODO: add grouping concat based chunks for decently managing new-lines within class/struct definitions
;TODO: make the indenting for template definitions/specializations consistent: currently there is a difference between templated functions and templated structures (mainly because there is not a standard form for functions)
;TODO: add properties back in - for user-defined indents and the like
;TODO: fix bug in FieldExpression.fm in constructor assignment list indent - no other repeatable test (yet)
;TODO: clean up eval in io.rkt to use racket/base and standard-chunks.rkt only - for speed?
;TODO: find a way to limit eval in io.rkt so that it doesn't have access to the file system  (something less than racket/base, probably)
;TODO: finish the top-level todo list ;)
