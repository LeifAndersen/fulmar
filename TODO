;TODO: change writer so that does indenting and new-lining after too many characters have been printed 
;       - this should eliminate the need for immediate-chunk
;TODO: write and test normal-chunk
;TODO: convert chunks from closure formulation to something transparent (a struct, probably)
;TODO: add new-lines-chunk and base new-line-chunk off of it
;TODO: add grouping concat based chunks for decently managing new-lines within class/struct definitions
;TODO: add properties back in - for user-defined indents and the like
;TODO: fix bug in FieldExpression.fm in constructor assignment list indent - no other repeatable test (yet)
;TODO: finish the top-level todo list ;)
